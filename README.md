How to use better OO design for the Zoo homework

# Overview

A guy posted a github repo link to a forum asking what we think about the OO design of his project. It was of course 
terrible, but instead of trolling it I started to think about what we can learn from his implementation and maybe
there is a way showing him how to do it a better way, or even a correct way. 

# The task

As a Zookeeper your task is to hold different spieces in your Zoo. Of course you are interested in living things, like
animals, and plants. 

Animals can be birds, fishes, or mammals. 

An animal can have certain number of legs, teeths, and an average weight, and a type:  predator, herbivorous, or unkown.

A bird is like an animal, but it has certain wing length. 
A fish is like an animal, but it can go down certain deep in the sea it lives. 
A mammal is like an animal, but it has a certain hair size.
